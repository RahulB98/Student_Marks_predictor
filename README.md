# Student_Marks_predictor
A linear regression based machine learning program in python<br>
This repository contains the jupyter notebook in which we explain the code for predicting the marks of a student baed on the study time devoted by him/her.<br>
The Sample data used for the training and testing for the model can be imported from the following url: "http://bit.ly/w-data"<br>
### Linear Regression:
Linear regression is a supervised learning approach that allows us to define the relationship between two or more variables that show independent and dependent characteristics.<br>
For furthure explanation about the algorithm and its implementation refer the jupyter notebook present in the repository and go checkout the code walkthrough hosted on Youtube at: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq5HuDqDPj0&t=263s"
